Developing a creative project for my web development course, namely a web interface for an art supply tracking system, inspired by my own chaotic collection.

To use, download the project and run <code>npm install</code> in the terminal. Run <code>npm start</code> and then open the displayed link or localhost:8000/

Try going to add-new.html and fill out the form. When you select a color family, it displays a bunch of colors you can select for the art supply you're adding. Cool stuff!
