Developing a creative project for my web development course, namely a web interface for an art supply tracking system, inspired by my chaotic collection.

To use, download the project and open index.html. Note that backend functionality such as true login and registration is not yet implemented. Clicking login/register will just redirect you to add-new.html, which also does not yet interact with the backend.

Try going to add-new.html and fill out the form. When you select a color family, it displays a bunch of colors you can select for the art supply you're adding. Cool stuff!
